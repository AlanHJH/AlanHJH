### About Me

Driven by curiosity, I'm a developer with more than 4 years of experience.
Technology and people are my passions, I love understanding how things work and how to use my knowledge to impact people's lives, in my area I've worked with a little bit of everything, from mobile to web, currently I'm more focused on full stack development for the web, using mainly the JavaScript language.
